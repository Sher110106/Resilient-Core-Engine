SECTION 9: KEY STUDENT QUOTES
============================================================

On Affordability:
"I order with my hostel wing almost every night, but delivery 
charges add up. We end up paying ₹50 extra just for someone to 
bring the food." - 3rd Year, IIT Delhi

"₹35 delivery charge on a ₹150 order feels like too much. We try 
to combine orders but the app doesn't make it easy." - 2nd Year, NIT Trichy

On Late-Night:
"Late night options are terrible. After 11 PM, it's basically just 
3-4 restaurants. We need more variety when we're pulling all-nighters." 
- 4th Year, BITS Pilani

"Mess closes at 9 PM. What are we supposed to do when we're hungry 
at midnight while studying? We need affordable late-night food." 
- 1st Year, Manipal

On Community & Engagement:
"Would love campus-only deals that make sense for our budget. We're 
ordering as a campus community, give us community pricing!" 
- 2nd Year, IIT Bombay

participating. IIT vs IIT competitions are huge on campus." 
- 3rd Year, IIT Madras

On Dine-Out:
"We don't know which restaurants near campus offer student discounts. 
A filter for student-friendly places would be super helpful." 
- 2nd Year, Delhi University

occasions. Need more affordable dine-out options." - 3rd Year, VIT Vellore
